Introduction To Operating Systems -------


What is an operating system?

-> Interface between user/program and computer hardware
-> Operating system is not a single program (It is a collection of a whole lot of programs)
   All of these programs together contributes to a kernel.
-> Resource manager
-> Control Program <System s/w>
-> Set of utilities to simplify application development

In the course of operating system we will learn the operating systems considering the von neumann architecture. Though when we change the architecture of the system, the operating system changes. A particular operating system can only work for a certain kind of architecture.

Kernel is the Operating System core. It is the actual operating system.
We as users/programmers never directly communicate with kernel. There is a command interface between us and kernel. (CLI or GUI).

levels -

1. users/programmers
2. command interface
3. kernel
4. hardware

programmers also user SCI(system call interface)/API(application programming interface) to communicate with the OS and getting special services.


Goals of operating system -

1. convenience -> easy to use
2. efficiency -> effective utilisation of hardware and software utilities
3. Scalability -> easy to add on and delete features
4. Robustness -> should be able to deliver services even when there are certain problems
5. Reliability
6. Portability -> Should be able to work for different processors etc
